## Project Purpose and Target

The aim of this project is to build a web app to allow users login with credentials and offering some operations such as listing their accounts, viewing its details and posting adverts for finding a band member. Basically it is a social media, users can post ads according to the criteria they are looking for and other users can comments under the posts. It is able to edit and delete comments/posts. Also, there is a section that users can list all postings by desired specifications. I used **Python Flask and MySQL** for development.

Firstly, this project is in a PWA (Progressive Web App) structure, so you can add this website to your homepage by creating a shortcut, almost like a mobile application, without the need for any plugins. PWA is a new web development technology and its use has been increasing in recent times. 

The project shows the latest updates regarding Covid-19. It lists the number of cases all over the world. In addition, users can list and manipulate all data in the table as desired. In addition, there is also latest Covid News section.
